# Hi, I'm Sokmeak 👋

🎓 I am a 5th-year IT student at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, majoring in Information and Communication Engineering.

💡 I am passionate about full-stack web development, with a strong interest in designing, building, and maintaining scalable web applications. I enjoy translating real-world problems into practical, reliable digital solutions.

🛠️ My experience spans both frontend and backend development, where I focus on clean architecture, maintainable code, and efficient system design. I am particularly interested in modern web technologies, RESTful APIs, and database-driven applications.

🚀 I continuously seek to improve my technical skills through hands-on projects, learning new technologies, and applying best practices in software engineering.

## 📌 Projects

- 🔖 **Inventory Management System**– A full-stack inventory and product management system built with Vue.js for the frontend, Java Spring Boot for RESTful backend services, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- 🌐 **E-commerce Site** – Built with Laravel and Vue.js, includes product management, user auth, and order history.
- 📲 **Local Job Board** – A Laravel-based platform to connect freelancers and employers in the local community.
